# Symbols

Text symbol characters for easy copy paste.

This is by no means an attempt to make a complate list of symbols, but more of a reference to the most commonly used symbols. If you know a symbol that you think should be present send a pull request and I'll add it!

For a full list of characters use one of the many sites out there, like http://copypastecharacter.com

Git note: Don't know if it is the right way to go, but to not have to sync `master` and `gh-pages` branch all the time I made `gh-pages` the defaut branch and removed `master`.
